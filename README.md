# Clonix - A Pygame-based Tetris Clone

## Overview
Clonix is a Tetris-like game built using the Pygame library. The game offers standard Tetris gameplay with customized visual assets, where you can rotate and move pieces (tetrominoes) to fill rows and score points. It features dynamic piece-dropping speed, a fading text effect for game-over messages, and support for custom block images.

## Dependencies

To run Clonix on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you need to install Python and Pygame. Use the following commands to install the required dependencies:

## Install Python and Pygame

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pygame 

sudo apt install python3-pillow ```   

- python-pillow is only needed if legacy/intitial_scripts are used to generate the very basic style. 
```

## Optional: Image Assets

The game comes with support for custom images for the tetromino blocks. You can place PNG images for the shapes (S.png, Z.png, I.png, O.png, J.png, L.png, T.png) in the assets folder. If images are not found, the game will fall back to using colored blocks for each shape.

## Running the Game

After installing the dependencies, clone the repository or copy the code to your local machine, and run the game with the following command:

```bash 

python3 clonix.py```
```
